** GLM Equations: **

A (Ground Truth) = shape(700,3) --> 700 rows (all responses) and 3 columns (3 layers)

B (Pipeline Output) = shape(700,3) --> 700 rows (all responses) and 3 columns (3 layers)

Let M be the transfer function for data fitting, then: 
B = M.A --> write in component form ********

To solve this equation, we consider: 
Cost Function = (B - M.A)^2

Taking derivateive of this, equating to 0 and solving for M, we get:
M = (A_T . A)^-1 . (A_T . B)

Now fitting data for column i of A with column i of B --> we get 3 Ms

Then, fitting data for column i of A with column i+1 of A --> we get 3 M_As

Then, fitting data for column i of B with column i+1 of B --> we get 3 M_Bs

PLotting all these Ms into one figure for each lobe and whole brain


Therefore, the equations for each layer are:

B_superfical = M_superficial . A_superficial
B_middle = M_middle . A_middle
B_deep = M_deep . A_deep
